				<h1>Midterm Project Rubric Part 2</h1>
				<p>1.Original JavaScript component:</p>
				<p class="bold"> menu.js: The javascript used for the side nav menu</p>
				<p>2.DHTML component:</p>
				<p class="bold">If the form is not filled in properly, then the missing fields will get highlighted in red</p>
				<h1>Midterm Project Rubric Part 1</h1>
        <p>	Good Design Techniques – CRAP. Alt and title attributes for each image</p>
        <p class="bold"> All pages use the same style.css file, creating a cohesive page</p>
        <p>	Use FireFox and test your responsiveness to a very small screen size as 22% wide.  Use the FireFox inspector.</p>
        <p class="bold"> The images disspear when the screen gets small, as well as adjusting the pop up menu</p>
        <p>	Many Media Queries – I want this project to be very “Mobile Friendly”</p>
        <p>	Your individual project must look good on my IPhone and my IPad, and my desktop.</p>
        <p>	If you can please do not reference pixels in any of your positioning.   For example an image
            Please notice in the above line you do not see width=220 or height=??</p>
        <p class="bold"> The webpage is still readable at smaller screens, and the images disspear allowing for a more mobile responsive webpage. None of the img tags contain height= or weight=</p>
        <p>	Organization of information – text and graphics make sense – logical – use the CSS float property for some images.</p>
        <p class="bold"> ALl the images float right next to the paragraph that they are meant to illustrate. It is very easy to tell which images belong to which section of the webpage</p>
        <p>	Content – interesting read, excellent grammar, perfect spelling.  Please do not make the content of text on the inside pages short.  Try to keep the first page (index) to one screen, no scroll bars.</p>
        <p class="bold"> The index page is short and sweet, and all of my pages have good grammar and spelling</p>
        <p>	Navigation – easy to get around, intuitive, well labeled</p>
        <p class="bold"> The index page is short and sweet, and all of my pages have good grammar and spelling</p>
        <p>	Use of HTML5 and CSS3 (both text and positioning) Valid HTML 5 and Valid CSS3 – Remember to use the validators demonstrated in class</p>
        <p class="bold"> Everything is 100% valid, besides the maps on the food page.</p>
        <p>	You must have some JavaScript.  The JavaScript must have a clear purpose and benefit your site.</p>
        <p class="bold"> Menu.js: This script holds the code for the pop up menu on the side, as well as the code that causes the pictures on sightseeing.php, activities.php, nature.php to change when you roll over them.</p>
        <p class="bold"> slideshow.js: This script controls the slideshow on the homepage (index.php)</p>
        <p>	That you modified your exercise 4 and included it in this project and made the form submit button work to send the forms contents to multiple email addresses.  Modify exercise 4 from when you submitted it previously.  Change the background color, logo, and the radio button content to relate to this project – the place you visited.  Also when you update exercise 4 for this project make sure this form has working links to all the pages of this project!
        <p class="bold"> EX04 was changed in the way that I changed it to suit the style of this new page. I also changed the questions to be related to new york, rather than new jersey. I changed the logo as well ,to the new york city logo.</p>
        <p>	SEE PAGE 3 of this problem Description --   Look How I want you to provide your references to pictures you put in this project.  Note the HTML Table.
        This separate reference page must be  linked to your front page.</p>
        <p class="bold"> All the images that I used that were not my own images are listed in reference.php. This page is accessible by the menu</p>
        <p>	 You will lose 30% for not having a "References" page. Follow my sample provided in this specification.  You can use an HTML table in this page.</p>
        <p class="bold"> All the images that I used that were not my own images are listed in reference.php. This page is accessible by the menu</p>
        <p>	Must have a Footer.  In the footer please have an HTML 5 icon that links to www.validator.w3.org and evaluates the current page.  I just want to click you HTML5 logo, and it tell me you have 100% valid HTML 5 code.   I want a line (border) separating the footer from the body.</p>
        <p>	In the footer have PHP code that shows the date stamp the file was last uploaded to Gibson.rit.edu</p>
        <p>	Same as above.  In the footer please have a CSS3 logo that when I click on it my screen will display that you have written structured valid CSS with no syntax errors and no  warnings.</p>
        <p class="bold"> The footer contains 2 validator links, one that connects to the css file and the second one that validates the html of the current page.</p>
        <p>	Do NOT use BOOTSTRAP in this project!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  No Content management programs allowed in this project.  Example, no Word Press sites, no CMS sites done using Joomla Drupal or Magento etc . . . .</p>
        <p class="bold"> This website was coded using nothing but a text editor!</p>
