  <h3>sdg3149(at)rit(dot)edu</h3>
  <p> I was born in Jersey City, New Jersey on April 27th 2001. But I have lived in Cliffside Park, New Jersey for my entire life. I am part of the 2019 graduating class of Bergen County Academies. Some of my hobbies include coding, writing, and designing. I also enjoy volunteering at the local animal shelter in my town, as well as Rochester. A major interest of mine is psychology.<br><br> The purpose of this website is to show my programming skills to potential employers and tell them a little bit about myself. My dream job is to be at a start-up company based around creating virtual psychiatry for people who can not afford the real thing. I want to be able to help people in the future. </p>
