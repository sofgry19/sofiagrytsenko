  <h1> Personal </h1>
  <p class="center"> Some of my interests include makeup, listening to music, and going to concerts. I love watching people do things that they are passionate about. I also enjoy coding games in my free time. Some small games include a tic tac toe and a card game in java; my biggest project yet was an educational mini-game made in Unity. <br>
  A couple clubs that I have enjoyed were oragami club, ColorInBca, and fashion club. I have also dabbled in playing the piano and guitar. Some sports I enjoy are skateboarding, ice skating, and skiing. </p>
